DEPRECATED: Newer versions of MineTest come with a real 3d player. If you have any usage for the model in another mod, feel free to use it.

This is a fork of PilzAdams 3d_player mod for Minetest which can be found here: https://github.com/PilzAdam/3d_player
It uses a diffrent model for the player. The model was created with Sapiers wielditem-editor which can be found here: http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3162
player.wim contains the model which can be opened with the above mentioned editor.

Original code: https://github.com/PilzAdam/3d_player

Liszence for code and model: WTFPL
